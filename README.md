# Medialikey

Medialikey is a web app that loads a list of pictures and allows users to
designate them as "like" or "not like", as well as the ability to view and
download their "like" list.  

The aim is to provide a way to gather inspiration, by providing a user-curated
group of photos and a quick way to sort through one's preferences.
It's similar to something like [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), but more
focused on the receiving end, than the showcasing part.  

This repository is the front-end, web client, built with Ember.
